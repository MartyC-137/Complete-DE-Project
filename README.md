# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023 Cohort

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises and projects in the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub)

## Course Outline

The course covers the following topics and contains code and examples for these:

- Google Cloud (Cloud Storage and BigQuery)
- `Terraform`
- Shell scripting
- `Docker` and containerization
- `Python` (Specifically, `Prefect`, a Python-based ETL/ELT tool)
- `SQL`
- `dbt`

In the course, you create cloud infrastructure using Terraform, cover the principles of Docker and containerization, create Python based ETL pipelines using Prefect, interact with the data using Google Cloud Storage and Google BigQuery, create models in dbt, and create reports from the data.

## Acknowledgments

The Data Engineering Zoomcamp was created by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub) and is an amazing resource for anyone looking to learn more about data engineering. As a practicing data engineer, I personally found the course to be great and learned a lot. Thank you to the instructors and contributors who created the course materials and provided guidance throughout the program.
